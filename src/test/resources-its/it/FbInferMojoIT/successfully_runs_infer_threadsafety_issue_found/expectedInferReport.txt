src/main/java/example/ClassWithThreadSafetyIssue.java:16: warning: Thread Safety Violation
  Unprotected write. Non-private method `ClassWithThreadSafetyIssue$Dinner.makeDinner()` indirectly writes to field `this.mTemperature` outside of synchronization.
 Reporting because the current class is annotated `@ThreadSafe`, so we assume that this method can run in parallel with other non-private methods in the class (including itself).
