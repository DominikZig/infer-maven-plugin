### Purpose

While the [Infer Static Analyzer](https://fbinfer.com/) is a very powerful static analysis tool, it is a bit clunky to use in Java projects. This Maven plugin eases the running of Infer in a Maven project, along with some sane defaults such as running all Java-related Checkers by default.

### Requirements

Currently it is confirmed to work with:
- Java 21
- Maven 3.8.6
- Linux

### Usage

Add the plugin to your POM:

```
<plugin>
  <groupId>io.github.dominikzig</groupId>
  <artifactId>infer-maven-plugin</artifactId>
  <version>0.1.0</version>
  <executions>
    <execution>
      <goals>
        <goal>infer-plugin</goal>
      </goals>
    </execution>
  </executions>
</plugin>
```

### Configuration

| Parameter | Description |
| :------- | -------: |
| `failOnIssue` | Flag to fail the Maven build if Infer reports any issues (defaults to `true`)  |
| `resultsDir`  | Path to set the output of the `infer-out` directory generated by Infer (defaults to under Maven `target` dir) |
| `installDir`  | Path to set the installation location of the Infer files themselves (defaults to under your user home `Downloads` dir) |
